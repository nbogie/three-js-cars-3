Not a game!  just learning three.js and how to work with some models from blender.

## controls:
* cursor keys to drive
* 'm' to change model / mesh
* 'o' to place a random object
* 't' to experimentally swap out the palette texture (not to a good one, yet! This will be used for headlights, colourising models, etc)
## TODO: 
* better shadow
* Dynamically switchable palettes to have many colourised cars out of one model.
* brake lights - with switched palette or different material
* car creator? (modular)
* smoke, skid marks?
* physics, including colliders for the track.  hopefully find a way to create them automatically from the track mesh.
* sound - synthesised?

## Recent changes
* added post processing glitching when "m" is pressed to change model / mesh.  reality dysfunction?
* added front wheel fake steering (no point working on this much until adding physics)
* added spinning wheels - not correlated to anything, currently (see above!)
